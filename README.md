# DatabaseFinal
This is my final project for database systems and can be demo'd using xamp as a server and local host.
It contains a microsoft word report and the entire code in another file.
The languages used were HTML, CSS, and PHP. SQL with the SQL workbench for the database.
I did a third of the code, i.e. two pages of the website, a colleague by the name of Charbel Azar did another third, and my other colleague Vladimir Abdel Nour did the SQL database code.
